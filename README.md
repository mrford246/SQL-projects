# SQL-projects and Data visualisations
A collection of my SQL projects and data visualisations 

1) Classic models - Using data from my udemy course, including order details like countries, customer number and items from a company.
   I explore the top 10 selling products and average number of orders placed by each customer. 
2) Pizza company - Using data from 8weekSQLchallenge.com, I investigated the average time of pick of each pizza by delivery drivers and total cost of pizza sold during the first two weeks.
